This is the slides,
supporting CSS,
and resulting code,
for Dave Aronson's talk
about genetic algorithms,
titled "Tight Genes: Intro to Genetic Algorithms".&nbsp;
It uses [revealjs](https://revealjs.com/),
which unfortunately means that
exporting to PDF is not at all straightforward.&nbsp;
But, I think you can figure out what's what pretty easily
just by looking through the HTML
(which uses "semantic linebreaks" to minimize false git-differences),
and pulling up the image files.&nbsp;
Or of course you can run revealjs on your own system.&nbsp;
